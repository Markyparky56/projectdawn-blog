        <p>
        Hey! I'm Mark, a student studying Computer Games Technology at Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland
        </br></br>
        I intend to use this site to document my ramblings and findings and to collect a portfolio of my work.
        This year I intend to attempt the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">OneGameAMonth</a> "Jam", my progress
        which will be documented here, which is one of the reasons I setup this website.
        </br></br>
        I have an interest in graphics programming and procedural generation. I aspire to eventually create an release
        a freely available engine capable of producing polygon landscapes produced from voxel maps.
