        <h1>Once More Unto The Breach</h1>
        <p class="text-muted">01 January 2015</p>
        
        <p>Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;<br>
Or close the wall up with our English dead.<br>
In peace there&#39;s nothing so becomes a man<br>
As modest stillness and humility:<br>
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br>
Then imitate the action of the tiger;<br>
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,<br>
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour&#39;d rage;<br>
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;<br>
Let pry through the portage of the head<br>
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o&#39;erwhelm it<br>
As fearfully as doth a galled rock<br>
O&#39;erhang and jutty his confounded base,<br>
Swill&#39;d with the wild and wasteful ocean.<br>
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,<br>
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit<br>
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.<br>
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<br>
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,<br>
Have in these parts from morn till even fought<br>
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:<br>
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest<br>
That those whom you call&#39;d fathers did beget you.<br>
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,<br>
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,<br>
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here<br>
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear<br>
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;<br>
For there is none of you so mean and base,<br>
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.<br>
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,<br>
Straining upon the start. The game&#39;s afoot:<br>
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge<br>
Cry &#39;God for Harry, England, and Saint George!&#39;  </p>
